# PocketFactions
A full-featured Factions plugin for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP).



**This is not quite ready for production servers**

# Commands
```
/f help <page> 
/f create <faction name>
/f disband
/f chat <mode> (alias: c)
/f description <new description> (alias: desc)
/f tag <new tag>
/f leader <player>
/f show [faction name]
/f list [factionless]
/f reload
/f save
/f version (alias: ver,v)
```

I put a ton of work into this to make it as close to [PC Factions](https://github.com/MassiveCraft/Factions) (The old version, not the s**t new one).
So please, give the repo a star.
